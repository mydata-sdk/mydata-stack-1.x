Test that the source converts to html witout errors either:

A) Copy the link: http://bit.ly/mydata2html to “Load from URL” in here: https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed

OR

B) Run on your command-line the following curl command:
```curl https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/ -F url=http://bit.ly/mydata2html > stack.tmp.html```

## Publishing in github

```git clone https://github.com/mydata-sdk/mydata-stack-1.x.git```

Download the plain txt [stack.bs](http://bit.ly/mydata2html) -file from Google Drive to the created mydata-stack folder (replace the older version of the file)

Create the html file from stack.bs with curl:

```curl https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/ -F file=@stack.bs > stack.html```

Test locally how the html file looks like and if OK commit and push:

```
git add stack.bs stack.html
git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE'
git push

```
